Sympl is a Toolkit for building Earth system models in Python.

Sympl hopes to enable researchers to easily perform online analysis and make
modifications to existing models by increasing the ease with which models
can be understood and modified. It also enables educators to write
accessible models that serve as an entry point for students into Earth
system modeling, while also containing state-of-the-art components.

Initially Sympl contains only components for the atmosphere, and does not yet
include a coupler. But there are plans to extend Sympl to a fully coupled Earth
system model in the future. The toolkit is also written in such a way that it
could enable the development of non-climate models (e.g. weather prediction,
large-eddy simulation). To do so requires only that the prognostic and
diagnostic schemes are wrapped into the correct Python-accessible interface.
